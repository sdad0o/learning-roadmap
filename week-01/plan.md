# Week 1 Summary – Java Core & OOP

## 🎯 Objective
Establish a solid foundation in Java by setting up the development environment, practicing object-oriented principles, and completing a CLI-based mini project.

---

## 🗓️ Daily Highlights

### ✅ Day 1 – Setup & Project Journal
- Installed JDK and IntelliJ
- Configured Git
- Created `learning-roadmap` repo with folder structure
- Wrote initial `README.md` and daily goals

### ✅ Day 2 – Classes, Fields & Methods
- Created `Media` base class with `Book` and `EBook` subclasses
- Wrote unit tests for constructors and getters
- Practiced encapsulation and method design

### ✅ Day 3 – Inheritance & Interfaces
- Used abstract methods and interfaces (`Printable`)
- Demonstrated polymorphism with a `List<Media>`
- Created a UML diagram to visualize class relationships

### ✅ Day 4 – Exception Handling & Memory Model
- Implemented custom exception (`BookNotFoundException`)
- Practiced try-catch blocks
- Sketched stack vs heap memory usage

### ✅ Day 5 – Recursion & Stack Tracing
- Wrote recursive `factorial(n)` and `fibonacci(n)`
- Traced call stacks and documented in diagrams

### ✅ Day 6 – Custom Collection & Big-O
- Implemented `MyArrayList` with `add()`, `get()`, `remove()`
- Annotated each method’s time complexity
- Compared with Java’s built-in `ArrayList`

### ✅ Day 7 – Mini Project: CLI Book Inventory
- Built CLI app for managing books (load/save using JSON)
- Added list, search, and sort commands
- Integrated custom exceptions and finalized `README`

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- `media/` package with tested classes
- UML and memory diagrams in `assets/diagrams`
- Recursive method demos and stack visuals
- `MyArrayList` with Big-O annotations
- `cli-book-inventory/` project with JSON and CLI logic

---

## 🔁 Reflection
- OOP design made code more modular and reusable
- Exception handling improved control flow clarity
- Recursion required deeper understanding of memory and stack frames
- CLI project was a great way to apply learned concepts
