# Week 2 Summary – Collections, Streams & DSA

## 🎯 Objective
Strengthen Java skills by exploring Collections, mastering Stream operations, and practicing Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with real-world problems.

---

## 🗓️ Daily Highlights

### ✅ Day 8 – Collections Performance & Big-O Review
- Benchmarked performance of `List`, `Set`, and `Map` operations
- Tabulated time measurements and added Big-O documentation
- Reflected on implementation tradeoffs and use cases

### ✅ Day 9 – Java Streams I: filter & map
- Filtered a `List<Book>` by author
- Mapped results to titles using `map()` and collected them
- Compared stream-based vs traditional imperative code

### ✅ Day 10 – Java Streams II: reduce & parallel
- Used `reduce()` to sum total page counts
- Explored `parallelStream()` and noted performance effects
- Measured timing differences and resource behavior

### ✅ Day 11 – DSA Easy: Arrays
- Solved:
  - `Two Sum`
  - `Valid Anagram`
  - `Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock`
- Created and documented solutions in `ds-practice/`
- Reflected on repeated patterns and optimizations

### ✅ Day 12 – DSA Medium: Arrays
- Solved:
  - `3Sum`
  - `Container With Most Water`
  - `Product of Array Except Self`
- Focused on two-pointer technique and time-space tradeoffs

### ✅ Day 13 – Advanced Streams: Collectors & Grouping
- Grouped books by genre using `Collectors.groupingBy`
- Partitioned books by page count using `partitioningBy`
- Built a custom collector to demonstrate flexibility

### ✅ Day 14 – Review, Testing & CI
- Wrote unit tests for stream utilities with JUnit 5
- Added CI badge for test coverage in `README.md`
- Wrote a weekly reflection and planned goals for Week 3

## 📦 Deliverables
- Performance benchmarks and Big-O notes
- Stream pipelines using `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, and `groupingBy`
- Solved 6 LeetCode problems (3 easy, 3 medium)
- Unit-tested utility methods and integrated CI
- Weekly reflection and planning for next phase

---

## 🔁 Reflection
- Streams greatly simplified collection processing
- Understanding collector patterns enhanced flexibility
- Solving LeetCode problems improved algorithmic thinking
- Performance benchmarking deepened awareness of complexity
- CI setup introduced habits for scalable testing
